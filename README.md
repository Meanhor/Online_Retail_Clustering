# Online_Retail_Clustering

This repository contains the analysis and visualization of customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) metrics. The project aims to:

* Segment customers into meaningful groups based on their purchase history.
* Visualize the distribution of customers across these segments.
* Provide insights into the average Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value for each segment.

The primary output is a bar and line graph illustrating the size of each customer segment and their average feature values. This visualization helps in understanding the characteristics of different customer groups and informing targeted marketing efforts.

## Key Findings (Based on the Provided Graph)

* The **NURTURE** segment comprises the largest customer base but exhibits relatively low average purchase frequency and monetary value.
* The **DELIGHT** segment, though smaller in size, represents high-value customers characterized by frequent and recent purchases with a high monetary value per transaction.
* The **RE-ENGAGE** segment is a significant group of customers who haven't made a purchase recently, indicating a potential need for re-engagement strategies.
* Other segments like **RETAIN**, **REWARD**, **PAMPER**, and **UPSELL** show varying levels of engagement and value, each requiring specific consideration in marketing campaigns.

## Usage

The provided graph visually summarizes the results of the customer segmentation analysis. To understand the underlying methodology and potentially replicate or extend this analysis, refer to the project's code and documentation (if available in other files).

This visualization can be used to:

* Identify key customer segments for targeted marketing.
* Understand the value and engagement level of different customer groups.
* Inform strategies for customer retention, upselling, and reactivation.

## Further Exploration

Further analysis could involve:

* Exploring the demographic or other characteristics of customers within each segment.
* Developing specific marketing strategies tailored to each segment.
* Tracking the performance of these strategies and refining the segmentation model over time.
